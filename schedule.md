# Schedule

<!--
Consistency:
Each Schedule entry can have:
- Questions - For weekly meeting questions to te supervisor
- Todo - Define goals and list here all progress done since the last schedule
-->

## 31 Jan - Weekly Meeting
### Questions
- There are some inconsistencies in the formatting of the dissertation where some paragraphs are not aligned etc... Also can i use a newline break to split two blocks of text where the context is different so its easier to distinguish the two paragrahps by context visually.

- [x] {fig:signal-decomposition} is saying Source: "Audio" but im not sure about this reference, maybe the bibtex entry i have rn isn't ideal?

- Maybe some state of the art sections might have very light information in the beggining specially for the RPD submission but with the writing of chapters 3 and 4 this will most likely change.

### Todo
- [x] Document Organization
- [1/2] Radix-2 DIT
- [1/2] Radix-2 DIF
- [ ] 2D and 3D transforms
- [ ] Add that the Cooley-Tukey can be performed in-place if the input sequence is already bit-reversed. I wanted to add this 
<!-- "It is important to note that, if the input signal data are placed in bit-reversed order before beginning the FFT computations, the outputs of each butterfly throughout the computation can be placed in the same memory locations from which the inputs were fetched, resulting in an in-place algorithm that requires no extra memory to perform the FFT." -->

## 4 Jan - RPD Submission
### Todo

- Fix acronyms/glossary
- Add Chapter experiments
- Add section with new work plan of the work that will be produced next and reflection of what was done
- Fix the Audio reference problem where i want "NTi Audio" to appear instead of just "Audio"
