- [2 weeks] Final practical corrections ...

### Writing

- Correct written practices: (Only at the end)
    - When talking about the work done remove the "We" and reference it as "It was done"
    - "listings" on the first page of the pre-dissertation stuff
    - Add/Update Keywords
- Review of the written text

<!--
x - Done
i - incomplete, because needs something from the final pratical phase

# 4 COMPUTATION OF THE FOURIER TRANSFORM
## 4.1 Improving the Cooley-Tukey algorithm
### 4.1.1 Natural order Cooley-Tukey
### 4.1.2 Stockham algorithm
### 4.1.3 Radix-4 instead of Radix-2
- Brief introduction to multiple factorizations
- Theres pros and cons to higher radix factorizations
- Mention there can be mix-radix implementations and that radix4 can be combined with radix2 easily to allow
to compute the same sizes
- Explain with dragonfly the main difference between stockham radix-2 and 4
-

# 5 IMPLEMENTATION ON THE GPU <!-- (or) GLSL, both titles apply -->
<!-- FIXME: Maybe change this title to GPU architecture -->
<!-- Programming model information will be mentioned in the implementation details in GLSL -->
## 5.1 GPU Programming model 
> Note: Since the readers might not be within HPC then i
need to introduce some roots to justify implementations

- GPU architecture brief
<!-- - GPU programming model brief -->

## 5.2 2D Fourier Transform on the GPU
- 2D FFT
- Two pass approach for Horizontal and Vetical passes
<!-- - Memory layout -->

## 5.3 Implementation Analysis in GLSL
- Matrix transposition mention

### 5.3.1 GLSL

- Brief of GLSL (what it is and how it is used)
- Why we're using it

### 5.3.2 Implementation

- Say it was an iterative process by applying, studying and testing
- 2D fft computes a lot of 1d fft's so each performancce improvement in the algorithms will be noticeable
- Explain every iteration of the FFT implmentations and GLSL and GPU programming good practices

<!--
#### Cooley-Tukey
- most naive implementation
- Mention to use GLSL bitreverse instead of manual
- pass per stage
    - The way it is dispatched and why it is made that way
- Updating to all stages in a single pass
    - One problem of this is the synchronization between threads

#### Radix-2 Stockam
- Why there are benefits on using stockham on the GPU
    - No bit reversal step

#### Radix-4 Stockam
- How the size of the kernel is affected by this and the performance acquired
- How there are less synchronization
- Why not higher radices? Cons of size constraints and portability to more GPUs
- Performance of higher radices depends on the hardware



-->

<!--
Say:
- In this thesis we provide a set of experiments that effectively study key components in the implementation of FFT's that
matter and impact the performance
-->


## 5.4 Case of study
### 5.4.1 Tensendorf waves
- Mention it is a good example to benchmark since the fft takes a big role into play (2 ffts multiple times) and effects most of the performance

### 5.4.2 Implementation details
- Explain the old implementation (and explain that it is an example of generic cooley-tukey pass per stage fft)
- Explain how it was implemented a better version using previous concepts

### 5.4.3 Results
- Compare the results of the previous implementation with the new implementation
- Possibly use many comfigurations for more deep testing
- Preview of the rendered image and graphs with the improvements results

<!-- #### Setup
- Implementation setup
    - Using Nau3D engine with 2 passes and 2 pingpong image buffers
- What application it was tested
    - The input image was sampled as a texture
    - 2D simple Forward FFt and Inverse FFT display mipmapped -->

# 6 ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON
- Explain whats this chapter about
- First we'll make the comparison with same algorithms in CUDA
- Then we'll talk about popular implementations and the merit they have and then compare them with our implementation in GLSL

<!-- 
## 6.1 cuFFT
## 6.2 Comparison with CUDA implementation
 -->

## 6.1 Popular implementations
- Talk about popular implementations
- FFTW but since we care about GPU oriented approaches we use as reference cuFFT

### 6.1.1 cuFFT
- What it is
- Pros and cons (NVIDIA only)
- Sample code for in and out of place implementations

### 6.1.2 Environment overhead

## 6.2 Comparison with CUDA implementation
- Brief the comparisons

### 6.2.1 CUDA Setup
Explain the setup of the comparisons and how does it differ from the GLSL implementation so that the results can be justified
Mention benchmark method (cuda events over the default stream)

### 6.2.2 Results
- attach all results and graphs

# 7 CONCLUSIONS
