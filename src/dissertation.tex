\section{Objectives}

The main objective of this dissertation is to provide efficient FFT alternatives in GLSL compared with dedicated tools for high performance of FFT computations like NVIDIA cuFFT library, while analysing the intrinsic of a good Fast Fourier Transform implementation on the GPU.
To accomplish the main objective there are two stages taken in consideration, "\textit{Analysis of CUDA and GLSL kernels}" to be well settled in their differences and to have a reference for the second stage "Analysis of cuFFT and GLSL FFT" which will cluster the study's main objective.

To compose a final verdict conclusion, we will use as case of study applications with implementation of the FFT in the field of Computer Graphics that require realtime performance.

\section{Fourier Transform}

%TODO:

\subsection{What is Fourier Transform}

The \textbf{Fourier Transform} is a mathematical method to transform the domain refered to as \textit{time} of a function, to the \textit{frequency} domain, intuitively the Inverse Fourier Transform is the corresponding method to reverse that process and reconstruct the original function from the one in \textit{frequency} domain representation.

Although there are many forms, the Fourier Transform key definition can be described as:

% Forward Fourier Transform
%FIXME: This equations are replacing the reference number for the name with '\eqname'
% It must show the name AND the number
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
    % \begin{split}
    X(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x(t)e^{-i \omega t} dt \\ \eqname{Forward Fourier Transform} \\
    % \end{split}
\end{equation}

% Invense Fourier Transform
%FIXME: This equations are replacing the reference number for the name with '\eqname'
% It must show the name AND the number
\begin{equation} \label{eq2}
        x(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} X(\omega)e^{-i \omega t} d\omega \\ \eqname{Inverse Fourier Transform} \\
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x(t) \rightarrow \) function in \textit{time} domain representation
    \item \( X(\omega) \rightarrow \) function in \textit{frequency} domain representation
    \item \( i \rightarrow \) imaginary unit \( i = \sqrt{-1} \)
\end{itemize}

% TODO: explain formula

This model of the fourier transform applied to infinite domain functions is called \textbf{Continous Fourier Transform} and its targeted to the calculation of the this transform directly to functions with only finite discontinuities in \( x(t) \).

\subsection{Where it is used}
\subsection{Discrete Fourier Transform}

The Fourier Transform of a finite sequence of equally-spaced samples of a function is the called the \textbf{Discrete Fourier Transform} (DFT), it converts a finite set of values in \textit{time} domain to \textit{frequency} domain representation. Its the most important type of transform since it deals with a discrete amount of data, which can be implemented in computers and be computed by specialized hardware.

% Forward Discrete Fourier Transform
\begin{equation} \label{eq3}
    X{\scriptstyle k} = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x{\scriptstyle n} \cdot e^{- \frac{i 2 \pi}{N}kn} \\ \eqname{Forward Discrete Fourier Transform} \\
\end{equation}
% Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform
\begin{equation} \label{eq4}
    x{\scriptstyle n} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1}X{\scriptstyle k} \cdot e^{\frac{i 2 \pi}{N}kn} \\ \eqname{Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform} \\
\end{equation}
